# An algorithm to test CW complexes on Euklidian embeddability
This repository contains the sources of my diploma thesis written in early 1994. That time I studied discrete mathematics in the workgroup of Prof. Dr. JÃ¼rgen Bokowski at the Technical University of Darmstadt (that time it was called "Technische Hochschule" - Institute of Technology, "South Hessian Institute of Technology" ;-))

This thesis is about Oriented Matroids, an abstraction of directed graphs and vector arrangements in a vector space over an ordered field. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_matroid) for some more details. The thesis' specialty is that it deals with another type of mathematical structures, [CW complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex), and their relation to oriented matroids, a topic I am not aware of somebody followed up upon (no comment with respect to relevance...)

## Why bother?
This is actually an attempt to recover "lost" information and the experiment to revive it some decades later. First positive aspect, the [original sources](/original) were stored on a 720k 3,5" diskette, and as you can see, it was still readible.
In steps I will revive the TeX document and the provided software to make my thesis replicable again.
